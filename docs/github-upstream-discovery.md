# GitHub-Native Upstream Discovery

The first upstream-registry integration should start with Homebrew metadata that already points at GitHub-hosted upstream downloads. This gives ubrew a practical seed set without treating every GitHub homepage as installable metadata.

Use:

```sh
scripts/discover-github-upstreams.mjs --limit 20
```

The script reads Homebrew's formula and cask API indexes, extracts `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` download URLs, and classifies them as:

- `github_release_asset`: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/...`
- `github_archive_source`: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/archive/...`

Do not treat Homebrew bottle URLs in `ghcr.io/homebrew/...` as verified upstream metadata. Those are Homebrew-produced bottles, not upstream project releases.

As of a scan on 2026-04-24 from `https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.json` and `https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.json`:

- Formula records: 8,317 total.
- Formula stable source URLs on GitHub: 5,039.
- Formula GitHub release asset sources: 724.
- Formula GitHub archive sources: 4,081.
- Formula GitHub repository clone sources: 232.
- Other Formula GitHub source URLs: 2.
- Formula GitHub source URLs with SHA256: 4,807.
- Cask records: 7,621 total.
- Cask GitHub release asset URLs: 2,077.
- Cask GitHub release URLs with SHA256: 2,063.
- Cask GitHub release URLs with `no_check`: 14.
- Cask GitHub release URLs with an app/pkg/binary artifact: 1,671.

Recommended integration order:

1. Casks with GitHub release URLs, SHA256, and a simple app/pkg/binary artifact. These map most directly into ubrew's existing cask installer. This is now the active first path for the embedded GitHub-release cask records, and `scripts/seed-upstream-casks.mjs` can promote popular app casks from Homebrew cask install analytics.
2. Formulae with GitHub release URLs and SHA256. These mostly describe source archives today, so use them first as trusted repo/tag/checksum allowlist records and inspect release assets before treating them as binary direct installs.
3. Formulae with GitHub archive URLs and SHA256. These are useful for a source-build track, but they do not preserve ubrew's fast bottle-style install path by themselves.

Promotion rule: a discovered candidate is not verified just because Homebrew points at GitHub. A registry record still needs an explicit repo allowlist, asset matching rule, OS/arch support, and checksum/signature/attestation policy.

After adding a candidate to `registry/upstream.json`, use `scripts/build-upstream-release-db.mjs` to review the release assets, GitHub asset digests, and repository advisories before copying resolved metadata into the registry. Generator changes should also pass the offline fixture test:

```sh
scripts/build-upstream-release-db.mjs --self-test
```
